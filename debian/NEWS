lilo (1:24.2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

 Lilo is at the end of development for some years. Finally the
 Debian package of lilo will be marked as deprecated and will 
 vanish as install package by the end of year 2020. Lilo will 
 removed well before the transition freeze of bullseye.

 I recommend to move to another bootloader e.g. grub2 in the
 next months.
